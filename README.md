Memory Game Instructions: Objective: Match all the pairs of numbers in the least number of moves.

Game Setup:

An array of numbers is displayed, each number appearing twice, face down. Each number represents a unique card. Game Rules:

The player starts with all cards facing down. On each turn, the player flips over two cards by entering the indices of the array. If the numbers on the cards match, they remain face up. If the numbers do not match, the cards are flipped back face down. The game continues until all pairs are matched. Display the total number of moves taken throughout the game. How to Play:

The array of numbers is displayed. Enter the indices of the array to flip a card. For example, to flip the card at index 3, enter "3". After entering the indices, the selected cards are revealed. Submission:
